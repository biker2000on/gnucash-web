# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.1.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- SimpleFin reconciliation matching: automatically links bank-imported transactions to existing manually-entered ones based on amount, date proximity, and description similarity
- Transfer dedup matching: detects when the same transfer is imported from both sides (e.g., checking → savings) and links them instead of creating duplicates
- "Bank-verified" badge on reconciled transactions in the account ledger
- Match count display in sync results (reconciled + deduplicated)
- Schema migration: `match_type`, `match_confidence`, `matched_at`, `simplefin_transaction_id_2` columns on transaction meta

### Changed
- Project description updated from "read-only" to reflect current read-write capabilities

### Fixed
- Currency precision: matching now uses account's `commodity_scu` instead of hardcoded precision=2, supporting JPY, KWD, and other non-standard currencies
- Transfer dedup restricted to 2-split transactions only, preventing incorrect split selection on multi-split transactions
- Match writes wrapped in database transactions for atomicity
- Removed split mutation from transfer dedup (no longer rewrites `splits.account_guid`)
